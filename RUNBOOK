The HA environment can be in several states, and it is desireable to place 
the systems into the fully replicated state as soon as possible. here are
the possible states, how to identify the state, and the corresponding 
procedure to repair the condition.

-----------
NOT PRESENT:
	the HA package has not been installed on the primary machine.

diagnosis:
	the HA directory is absent from the controller directory.

to fix:
	cd <controller root> ; mkdir HA ; cd HA ; bash <path>/HA.shar
	then follow the steps for UNINSTALLED

-----------
UNINSTALLED:
	the package is present in the controller HA directory, but the
	services have not been installed.

diagnosis:
	service appdcontroller status shows appdcontroller service not found

to fix:
	cd <controller root>/HA
	become root
	./install-init.sh [-c | -s]

------------
NO HOSTS:
	the secondary machine does not have a resolvable host name

diagnosis:
	ping <secondary> returns unknown host

to fix:
	add the primary and secondary host name into both machines /etc/hosts files
	
------------
NO SSH:
	the appdynamics user does not have no-password ssh access between
	machines.

diagnosis:
	ssh <secondary> date prompts for a password

to fix:
	in the below, you will be prompted for passwords and confirmations
	ssh-keygen -P "" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -t rsa
	ssh <secondary> ssh-keygen -P "''" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -t rsa
	scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub <secondary>:.ssh/authorized_keys
	scp <secondary>:.ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

------------
UNREPLICATED: the HA package has been installed on the primary controller,
but the package has not been activated.

diagnosis:
	service appdcontroller-db status shows "HA not installed" 

to fix:
	cd <controller root>/HA
	./replicate -s <secondary>
	<become root on secondary>
		cd <controller root>/HA
		./install-init [-c | -s]
		exit
	<back on primary>
	./replicate -s <secondary> -e <vip>	-f
		confirm

----------
DISCONNECTED:
Replication communication is being blocked, HA has been installed and activated,
but a firewall is preventing access to replication communications.

diagnosis:
	service appdcontroller-db status shows 
		"Slave_IO_State: Connecting to master"
		"Seconds_Behind_Master: NULL"

to fix:
	disable the firewall for port 3388
	brute force as root:  iptables -F

----------
REPLICATED, WATCHDOG RUNNING: 
the HA package is running fully replicated, and the primary node is serving
agents with metric storage, and the UI is responsive.  the secondary is
monitoring the primary appserver with a watchdog process.

diagnosis:
	service appdcontroller status on the primary reports:
	db running as <user> - active
	primary
		Slave_IO_State: Waiting for master to send event
	controller running

	service appdcontroller status on the secondary reports:
	db running as <user> - passive
	secondary
		Slave_IO_State: Waiting for master to send event
	watchdog running

to fix:
	nothing to fix

----------
REPLICATED, WATCHDOG NOT RUNNING: 
the HA package is running fully replicated, and the primary node is serving
agents with metric storage, and the UI is responsive.  the secondary is
not monitoring the primary appserver with a watchdog process.

diagnosis:
	service appdcontroller status on the primary reports:
	db running as <user> - active
	primary
		Slave_IO_State: Waiting for master to send event
	controller running

	service appdcontroller status on the secondary reports:
	db running as <user> - passive
	secondary
		Slave_IO_State: Waiting for master to send event
	watchdog not running

to fix:
	on the secondary
	cd <controller root>/HA
	touch WATCHDOG_ENABLE
	/sbin/appdservice appdcontroller start

---------
FAILED OVER, old primary broken
The current active node has become active because of a failover.  the prior
active node's database is inaccessible.  the assassin is running on the new
active node to mark the old active node passive once it comes up.

diagnosis:
	service appdcontroller status on the primary reports:
	db running as <user> - active
	secondary
		Slave_IO_State:
		Seconds_Behind_Master: NULL
	assassin running

to fix:
	replicate from the new active node to the old active node using
	the formula for UNREPLICATED

------------
FAILED OVER, watchdog running
The current active node has become active because of a failover.  the prior
active node database is still intact, and replication is valid. the new
secondary node has a watchdog running.  this is identical to the REPLICATED,
WATCHDOG_RUNNING state.

diagnosis:
	service appdcontroller status on the original primary reports:
	db running as <user> - passive
		Slave_IO_State: Waiting for master to send event
	secondary
	watchdog running

	service appdcontroller status on the original secondary reports:
	db running as <user> - active
	primary
		Slave_IO_State: Waiting for master to send event
	controller running

to-fix:
	no need to fix anything.  should it be desired to make the original node
	the active node:

	on the original primary,
	cd <controller root>/HA
	./failover.sh

-------------
PASSIVE DOWN
this is a state deliberately caused to perform a consistent backup of the
database.   it is initiated on the passive node by running:
/sbin/appdservice appdcontroller-db stop

diagnosis:
	/sbin/appdservice appdcontroller-db status on the passive node reports:
	db not running

to-fix:
	on the passive controller,
	/sbin/appdservice appdcontroller start

-------------
ERROR: bash: get_mysql_passwd: unable to get MySQL root passwd. As appdyn user run HA/save_mysql_passwd.sh interactively and try again.

diagnosis:
	A stored MySQL root password, obfuscated or clear has not been found. Storing the 
	MySQL root password to disk is a requirement for the HA Toolkit running with
	service which in turn needs privilege escalation eg /sbin/appdservice or sudo or pbrun

to-fix:
	> on the server as the intended AppD user (here "appdyn"):
	HA/save_mysql_passwd.sh 
	> this will persist the password after obfuscating it
