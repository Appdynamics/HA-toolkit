This document describes best practices for system patching of an HA
pair.  this can be accomplished without significant data loss if a
load balancer has been properly configured. it assumes a HA toolkit
version of >= 3.41.  the process may be run with earlier versions with
appropriate modification of the service start and stop procedure.

the process at a high level is essentially to do orderly shutdowns in turn,
with a failover between to absorb the metric load.  the total time to patch
the systems will be extended by the amount of needed to allow the mysql
instance on the secondary to catch up.

in the below description, please substitute your controller install directory
for $APPD_ROOT

the detailed flow:

on the secondary host: 
1) stop the mysql instance using:
   $APPD_ROOT/HA/appdservice.sh appdcontroller-db stop
   this will automatically stop the watchdog process as well if it present.

2) uninstall the init scripts.  this is to prevent the patching process
   from inadvertently starting the database without a clean shutdown

   HA/uninstall-init.sh

3) patch the secondary machine.  upgrade the OS, libraries, security policies,
   etc.  bring up the machine multi-user.

4) log in as the root user and reinstall the init scripts using the
   install-init.sh script using the options that were previously used.
   this can be found by running the following command:

   grep "command line options" $APPD_ROOT/logs/install-init.log | tail -1

   $APPD_ROOT/HA/install-init.sh  <options from above>

5) start the appdynamics services
   $APPD_ROOT/HA/appdservice.sh appdcontroller-db start
   $APPD_ROOT/HA/appdservice.sh appdynamics-machine-agent start


6) wait for seconds behind master to equal 0.  if the status shows broken
   replication by reporting NULL for seconds behind persistently, STOP and
   fix replication.  DO NOT PROCEED with a broken database.  inspect the
   logs/database.log to determine the cause.

   $APPD_ROOT/HA/appdstatus.sh

7) fail over to the secondary node.

   $APPD_ROOT/HA/failover.sh

8) once the new primary controller has been validated to work and is accepting
   metrics, proceed on the former primary with steps 1 - 6.  at this point,
   both systems have been patched and you may fail over to the original node
   if desired.
