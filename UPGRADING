upgrading the HA toolkit usually does not require a re-replicate or restart of the 
application or database.

to upgrade the HA toolkit, 

1) copy or move the HA.shar to the HA directory
2) unpack it using bash HA.shar
3) inspect the /etc/sysconfig or /etc/default versions of
   the *.sysconfig files to see if any midifications have been made to them.
   if so, merge the differences to the sysconfig files in this directory.
   edit any settings you might need in the sysconfig files.
4) inspect the watchdog.settings.template file to see if any additions have
   been made, and merge them into your watchdog.settings file
5) recursively copy the HA directory to the secondary HA directory
6) run install-init with the appropriate options as root on the primary
7) run install-init on the secondary in the same way
8) restart the watchdog on the secondary if enabled. do this
   by stopping the secondary appdcontroller service and then starting it.
9) validate both installations by running appdstatus.sh
