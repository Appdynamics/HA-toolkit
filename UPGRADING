The HA package is installed in the HA subdirectory of the controller
root.  This can be determined from examining the running executable path
of the mysql process.   In the following description, this directory,
which has the bin, logs, db, and appserver subdirectories, will be referred
to as /controller_root. The appdynamics service account will be denoted by
appdyn.

Upgrading the HA toolkit usually does not require a re-replicate or restart of the application or database.

1) become the appsynamics user and cd to the controller_root directory
   all the following commands are performed from the /controller_root.

	su - appdyn
	cd /controller_root

2) save the state of the HA configuration.  make a recursive copy of the 
   HA directory and capture /etc/sysconfig/appd* and /etc/init.d/appd*. 
   the latter 2 sets of files may not be accessible to the appdynamics user, 
   depending on permissions.

	cd /controller_root
	cp -r HA HA.save
	mkdir -p HA.save/init
	mkdir -p HA.save/sysconfig
	cp /etc/init.d/appd* HA.save/init
	cp /etc/sysconfig/appd* HA.save/sysconfig

3) retrieve the most recent version of the HA.shar file
   https://github.com/Appdynamics/HA-toolkit/releases/latest
   currently, there is no direct link to the latest HA.shar, due
   to limitations in github.
 
4) copy the downloaded HA.shar to the HA directory

	cp /tmp/HA.shar /controller_root/HA

5) unpack it using bash HA.shar

  	bash HA.shar
 
6) inspect the /etc/sysconfig or /etc/default versions of
   the *.sysconfig files to see if any midifications have been made to them.
   if so, merge the differences to the sysconfig files in this directory.
   edit any settings you might need in the sysconfig files.

	for i in appdcontroller appdcontroller-db appdynamics-machine-agent ; do
		diff HA/$i.sysconfig HA.save/sysconfig/$i
	done

7) inspect the watchdog.settings.template file to see if any additions have
   been made, and merge them into your watchdog.settings file

	diff HA/watchdog.settings.template HA.save/watchdog.settings

8) recursively copy the HA directory to the secondary HA directory

	scp -r HA secondary_host:/controller_root

9) if not using the restricted NOROOT function, 
   run HA/install-init.sh with the appropriate options as root on the primary
	if using sudo to do privilegs escalation:

	sudo /controller_root/HA/install-init.sh -s	

   if using the c wrapper:

	sudo /controller_root/HA/install-init.sh -c	

10) run HA/install-init.sh on the secondary in the same way

11) restart the watchdog on the secondary.

	sudo service appdcontroller stop
	sudo service appdcontroller start

12) verify that the appdynamics processes and HA installation is functional:
	run the following on both nodes. if it shows healthy operation, the
    /controller_root/HA.save directory can be removed.

	/controller_root/HA/appdstatus.sh
   
FAIL CASE) should the installation go poorly, the HA upgrade can be backed
   out by removing the HA directory, and renaming /controller_root/HA.save
   as /controller_root/HA.  to replace the sysconfig and init files, the
   old install-init.sh should be run.  validate that the /etc/init.d and 
   /etc/sysconfig files saved in HA.save in step 1 are identical.
