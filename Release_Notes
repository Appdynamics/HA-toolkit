Release notes for version 3.0

In addition to bug fixes, the package has been substantially enhanced and 
re-written for enhanced portability, security, performance and maintainability.

The following new functionality is present:

1) replicate optionally can use of non-encrypted rsync.  in environments where 
a VPN or a dedicated network exists between primary and secondary controllers, 
replication can be noticably faster.  this is enabled by using the -U option.

2) mysql replication can use SSL encryption.  a pair of signed certificates 
and keys is exchanged between the 2 mysql instances.  after this negotiation,
all communication for mysql replication is encrypted.

3) mysql replication compression is enabled by default

4) the secondary no longer places replicated traffic in it's bin-logs.  this
greatly decreases disk usage on the secondary

5) scripts and support files are added for NUMA segregation

6) the machine agent is can run as non-root, and automatically is configured
with additional monitors to surface custom mysql and disk metrics. also,
the machine agent is automatically detected if it is in the controller root
directory or it's parent.  we use the controller JVM, so there is no need
to install anything other than the Java-less zip file of the machine agent.

7) configuration of an external monitoring host is simplified

8) support for controller versions greater than 4.2.0, which removed the
plaintext password file for mysql root.  we have 2 distinct solutions to
this:  recreate the db/.rootpw file, or run the save_mysql_passwd.sh script
which obfuscates the password and save that, unscrambling it whenever it is
needed

9) more extensive logging of the replicate process

10) init script configuration is now done via sysconfig files installed in
/etc/sysconfig (for redhat) or /etc/default (for debian).

11) greater compatibility with systemd.  newer linux distributions have a
different implementation of boot time init script handling, which does not
support the clean execution of the service status verb.  this is deprecated
on these systems, and a new script,  HA/appdstatus.sh, is supplied to replace 
this functionality.

Significant bug fixes in this release:

1) files of size less than 1M are checksummed to prevent rsync missing them
if changes to the file did not cause it to grow

2) the database health check now recovers if one of the steps timed out.

3) failover can not longer oscillate between two machines

4) the secondary controller now waits until the relay logs have been executed
before starting the new appserver on failover.   although this can take quite
some time, it prevents database inconsistencies.

------------------------------------
Release notes for version 3.0.1

this is a minor bugfix and enhancement release.

1) added support for fairly ugly root mysql passwords.  whitespace characters
are not supported, but punctuation is ok, plus $*()...

2) failover is a bit smarter about breaking replication.   all things being
otherwise ok, if the old primary has been up at least 1 hour, we don't break
replication

3) in the case of a persistent replication break, if we KNOW that the database
is not damaged on each end, we can run replicate -E to restore the slave to
operation.

4) the machine agent is started with nodename set

5) install_init.sh changes ownership of the machine agent to RUNUSER

6) Documentation on machine agent startup additions
