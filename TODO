replicate bug: https:// vip with no port does not set -Dappdynamics.controller.port= jvm-option and did not set <controller-ssl-enabled>true</... in controller agent controller-info.xml files

replicate.sh:
	add update logic
	
make a make-keys script
make a check-prerequisites script
make a system-check script
	deadline (or controller running on ZFS)
	swap space
	nofile ( moot point.  handled by init script)
	swappiness
	sizing (heap, buffer cache) ram total
iptables rule for 3388

enable event service marker file obeyed by init scripts.

port number for https://external without port number generates bogus hostname

monitoring extension:

surface:
	watchdog running

excludefiles
numeric host names only

watchdog:  only ping ports that are listening
