### Use `gitflow-avh` to manage development branches and releases

Git Flow automates [a number of excellent conventions for managing branches, merges, and releases](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).  `gitflow-avh` is the actively maintained fork of the original Git Flow project:

* Easily installed on Mac OS X via homebrew
* Wiki: https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh/wiki

Git Flow maintains a pair of branches: `develop` and `master`.  `develop` contains every merged feature and bug fix.  `master` only contains released, production-ready code.  A bug fixes our features are branched from develop and then merged back in.

***Please note that only Curt Mayer, the project architect, has push privileges to the `develop` and `master` branches in this repository.***  To get your features and fixes merged into `develop` and released into `master`, please follow the procedures below.
